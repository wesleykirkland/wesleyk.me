This is the first paragraph of the test post. It should have proper spacing below it.

This is the second paragraph. Notice how there's exactly one blank line between this paragraph and the previous one.

This is the third paragraph with some **bold text** and _italic text_ to test formatting.

## This is a Header 2

Under this header, we have another paragraph. Headers should have proper spacing above and below them.

Here's a paragraph with some `inline code` to test code formatting.

### This is a Header 3

This section demonstrates lists:

- First list item
- Second list item
- Third list item with some longer text to see how it wraps

Here's an ordered list:

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block:

```javascript
function testFunction() {
  console.log('This is a test');
  return true;
}
```

And here's a PowerShell example:

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 100} | Select-Object Name, CPU
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote to test formatting.
> It should have proper indentation and styling.

## Links and Final Paragraph

Here's a [link to Google](https://google.com) to test link formatting.

This is the final paragraph of the test post. It should demonstrate that all the formatting works correctly with proper spacing between elements.
