# Urllo and Ministry Brands

## Executive Summary

In 2017, I joined Ministry Brands as a Senior Cloud Engineer during a period of explosive growth where we consolidating our business from all of our previous acquisitions. We were preparing to expand white-label services, and modernize the infrastructure for over 25 applications and 50+ white labels websites. Our DNS and redirect strategy? Manual, fragile, and increasingly unscalable by the day. One of my favorite remarks from our time was from one of our business leaders unprompted to our VP.

> I don't know what your team is doing, but we used to have an SSL outage or domain outage weekly. We haven't had one in months and we're noticing. Keep up the good work.

We needed a better way to manage thousands of redirects and secure every domain with SSL—without burning hours on cert renewals or risking downtime.

# The Problem: SSL & Redirect Chaos at Scale

Our existing DNS provider didn’t offer automation for redirect configuration or SSL provisioning. Every time we needed a redirect or campaign path, our infrastructure team had to manually:

- Determine what options were available for the particular domain
- Configure DNS entries
- Set up redirects (often path-based)
- Issue, monitor, and renew SSL certificates
- Validate everything stayed secure and performant

This created serious bottlenecks. We were spending too much time firefighting and not enough time engineering.

# The Solution: Partnering with urllo (formerly EasyRedir)

That’s when we found urllo. As part of the evaluation team, I quickly saw how their platform could eliminate our bottlenecks:

- Centralized redirect management: A single dashboard to manage thousands of redirect pairs.
- Instant, automated SSL provisioning: No more cert scripts or Let’s Encrypt acrobatics.
- High-performance infrastructure: Lightning-fast response times, near-zero latency, and a global AWS powered infrastructure.

## Fun stuff

- One of our team members Jon Knight in his spare time even wrote a full [.NET compatible SDK](https://github.com/jmknight2/EasyRedirSDK) for Urllo which is still compatible to this day.
- Urllo and I still are personal partners to this day. During their rebrand they posted [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarah-ellis-92713bb_say-hello-tourllour-loh-im-thrilled-activity-7267169570740662272-NhDj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAb3Hd0BSHxSbdnFkL_r33zMsKbzTuwoEv4) outlining our partnership 7 years later
